ReceiveDmx - Arduino code for turning making an Arduino Ethernet convert UDP packets into DMX512

1. Download Arduino and the DmxSimple library
http://arduino.cc
http://code.google.com/p/tinkerit/wiki/DmxSimple

2. Install Arduino

3. Extract the DmxSimple library in your Arduino libraries directory
(On OS X this is in Documents/Arduino/libraries)

4. Open DmxOverEthernet/ReceiveDmx/ReceiveDmx.ino

5. Compile the code for Arduino Ethernet and upload

6. Wire the Arduino Ethernet with a max485 chip
